phasereset
==========

phasereset is a MATLAB package that allows the generation of simulated EEG data via the classical theory and phase reset. The aim of this project is to provide a more MATLAB friendly version of the original phasereset code in the form of a separate package to avoid name collisions.

The original work and a brief tutorial can be found at http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~rafal/phasereset/.
